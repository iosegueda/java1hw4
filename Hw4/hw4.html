<p><br /> 1. Write a class called <tt>Rectangle</tt> that maintains two attributes to represent the length and width of a rectangle. Provide suitable <tt>get, set,</tt> and <tt>toString</tt> methods plus two methods that return the perimeter and area of the rectangle. Include two constructors for this class. One a parameterless constructor that initializes both the length and width to 0, and the second one that takes two parameters to initialize the length and width.</p>
<p>2. Write a java program (a driver application) that tests the above class by providing the users with the following menu options: <br /> <br /> 1 - to set the length <br /> 2 - to set the width <br /> 3 - to get the length <br /> 4 - to get the width <br /> 5 - to get the perimeter <br /> 6 - to get the area <br /> 7 - to print the object as string <br /> 0 - to quit <br /> <br /> Your program should create one <tt>Rectangle</tt> object at the beginning using the default constructor, and then repeatedly call the appropriate method for that object depending on the user selection from the above menu. Use <tt>JOptionPane</tt> for all input/output.</p>
<p>You should name the application file Hw4.java and submit it along with the Rectangle.java file.</p>
